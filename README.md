# Pizza Planet

Pizza Planet is a family friendly pizza restaurant with a space theme. Its website was designed as a single page to be simple to read and use on both desktops and mobile devices. The centered column-like style of the page is meant to keep the user's eyes from having to wander too far to find what they're looking for.

The site displays the restaurant's logo upfront followed by a small description along with a promotional video. It also has a pizza menu and a Sign-up form to receive deals in the user's email inbox as well as a chance to win free pizzas.
